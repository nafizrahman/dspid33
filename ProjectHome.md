this is the firmware that runs on my dsNavCon prototype board, on MuIn dsNav 990.011 Droids board and on Robocontroller board to drive a robot with PID controlled speed, direction and distance, with odometry and field mapping, autonomously or remotely controlled by a GUI:

The navigation board can be interfaced with a sensors board to interact with the unknown environment:
